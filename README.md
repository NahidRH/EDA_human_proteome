# 🧬 eda-human-proteome (Exploratory Data Analysis of Human Proteins)

Hi there 👋  
This is a small bioinformatics project where I explore various properties of human proteins using data from [UniProt](https://www.uniprot.org/).  
I wanted to better understand how features like sequence length, molecular weight, subcellular location, and functional annotations are distributed across the human proteome — and have some fun with data along the way.

## 📌 What I do here:

- Load reviewed human protein data (Swiss-Prot entries from UniProt)
- Perform basic exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Visualize:
  - Sequence length distributions
  - Molecular weights
  - Subcellular locations
  - Common functional keywords
- Build visual dashboards to interact with the data

## ✨ Why I made this:
I enjoy combining data and biology. This project helps me showcase some data analysis skills in a bioinformatics context — and who knows, maybe inspire someone else too!

Feel free to fork or reach out ✨
